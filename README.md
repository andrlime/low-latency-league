# Low Latency League

Welcome to the low latency league! This is an internal NUFT challenge to see who can make the fastest matching engine. 

# Testing

The premise is simple: optimize the provided matching engine. Your submission must pass all tests (`make test`) to be considered. 

# Benchmarking

Submit your submission for benchmarking via scholes. There is a live leaderboard, but you can choose to remain anonymous.

Benchmarks will call your orderbook functions (add, remove, match, etc). They are designed to somewhat reflect real world conditions. For example, during times of high volatility, we may see XYZ finish this.
