Welcome to the low latency league! This is an internal NUFT challenge to see who can make the fastest matching engine. 

The premise is simple: optimize the provided matching engine. All tests are provided and can be run via COMMAND.

Test cases will call your orderbook functions (add, remove, match, etc). They are designed to somewhat reflect real world conditions. For example, during times of high volatility, we may see XYZ finish this.
